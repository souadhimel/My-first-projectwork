    <h3>A land of hapiness & peace </h3>
    <p class="bangla">Last among the nations to emerge on the Indian subcontinent after a brief, brutal war in 1971 with Pakistan, of which it had been a part since 1947, Bangladesh (liter­ally Bengal country and formerly known as East Pakistan) is a small, impoverished and overcrowded nation. Before inde­pendence it was separated from Pakistan’s western region (formerly known as West Pakistan) by some 920 miles (1,554 km) of Indian Territory; its political link to West Pakistan was based largely on religious grounds.</p></div>

        <h1>Water Lily</h1>
            <p class="flower">Water Lily (shapla) an aquatic plant of the genus Nymphaea which has large, disk-like, floating leaves and showy flowers. There are about 50 species growing in different countries. In Bangladesh there are two species: N. nouchali (blue variety) and N. pubescens (white variety). Both species grow abundantly as a mixed population in almost all shallow natural waterbodies, but the latter is more frequent and popular in Bangladesh and has been designated as the national flower.
            Another species, N. rubra, is often cultivated in ponds and tanks as an ornamental plant. Each plant produces several solitary flowers with long peduncles and blooms above the water surface.
            It is seen in abundance in the monsoon season. The peduncle is a popular vegetable to villagers; the tuberous rhizomes are also eaten. Seeds on frying are eaten as puffed-grains in some places. The giant water lily or Amazon water lily (Victoria amazonica) is occasionally grown in some gardens for its enormous (about 2m in diametre) orbicular floating leaves.</p>
